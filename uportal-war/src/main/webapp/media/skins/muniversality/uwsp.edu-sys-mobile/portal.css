/**
 * uPORTAL PORTAL CSS
 * These declarations are scoped for the portal, and not specifically for portlets.
 * For portlet-specifc CSS, see "portlet.css" in the same directory.
 * CSS specified at the portal scope will naturally cascade into portlets.
 * This CSS begins with the Fluid Skinning System (FSS) specification and is followed by uPortal-specfic extensions and overrides.
 * This CSS assumes the use of a CSS reset (by default the FSS "fss-reset.css") for browser normalization.

/**
 * uPORTAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
 * For the standards and guidelines that govern the user interface of uPortal portlets including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, accessibilty, naming conventions, 3rd Party libraries (like jQuery and the Fluid Skinning System) and more, refer to:
